### 4 events for 1 Fest of Empirical Syntax

 The second edition of the SyntaxFest brings together again four events with partially overlapping research topics including empirical syntax, linguistic annotation, statistical language analysis, and Natural Language Processing:
* [Quasy](https://quasy-2021.webnode.cz/) : The Workshop on Quantitative Syntax
* [Depling](https://depling.org/depling2021/) : The Conference on Dependency Linguistics
* [TLT](https://tlt2021.phil.hhu.de/) : The International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories 
* [UDW](https://universaldependencies.org/udw21/) : The Universal Dependencies Workshop

### <a name="talks"> Invited talks </a>

* [Jinho Choi](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/home.html), Emory University: _Widely Interpretable Semantic Representation: Frameless Meaning Representation for Broader Applicability_

> In this talk, I will present a new semantic representation, WISeR, that overcomes challenges for Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). Despite its strengths, AMR is not easily applied to languages or domains without predefined semantic frames, and its use of numbered arguments results in semantic role labels not directly interpretable and semantically overloaded for parsers. We examine the numbered arguments of predicates in AMR and convert them into thematic roles which do not require reference to semantic frames. We create a new corpus of 1K English dialogue sentences annotated in both WISeR and AMR. WISeR shows stronger inter-annotator agreement for beginner and experienced annotators, with beginners becoming proficient in WISeR annotation more quickly. Finally, we train a state-of-the-art parser on the AMR 3.0 corpus and a WISeR corpus converted from AMR 3.0. The parser is evaluated on these corpora and our dialogue corpus. The WISeR model exhibits higher accuracy than its AMR counterpart across the board, demonstrating that WISeR is easier for parsers to learn.

* [Jennifer Foster](https://www.dcu.ie/computing/people/jennifer-foster), Dublin City University: _Treebanking and Parsing for Irish_

> In this talk I will discuss recent work on treebanking and parsing for the Irish language, carried out by researchers in the Natural Language Processing group in the School of Computing in DCU. The first part of the talk will be devoted to TwittIrish, a treebank of tweets annotated according to the Universal Dependencies (UD) guidelines. I will discuss phenomena associated with this particular language/genre pair which can make the annotation process challenging, including the way in which the language found in Irish tweets differs from standard Irish, and the effect of English. I will present and analyse the results of parsing TwittIrish using state-of-the-art neural dependency parsers trained on the Irish Universal Dependencies treebank. This will lead on to the second part of the talk in which an Irish BERT language model, gaBERT, will be presented. Design decisions taken in training gaBERT will be presented, and the model will be compared to multilingual BERT on the task of UD dependency parsing and using a manual cloze-test evaluation.

* [Richard Futrell](http://socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/), University of California, Irvine: _An Information-Theoretic Perspective on Dependency Trees_

> I give an overview of some recent work taking a corpus-based, information-theoretic view on problems of dependency grammar. First, I argue for a connection between syntactic dependencies and the information-theoretic notion of mutual information, a measure of how strongly two words constrain each other, which allows us to quantify the “strength” of the link between a dependent and its head. Next, I present theoretical motivations and empirical evidence for information locality: a generalization of dependency length minimization which holds that words are under a pressure to be close to each other in word order in proportion to their mutual information. Finally I present evidence that crosslinguistic word orders reflect optimization for recoverability of dependency relations from strings of words.

* [Sylvain Kahane](https://kahane.fr/), Université Paris Nanterre: _Quantitative studies on tree bank collections: Complexity, universals, and typological signature_

> Thanks to the Universal Dependencies database, we now have collections of treebanks annotated according to common guidelines. Such collections allow us to verify properties supposedly common to all languages of the world, but also to contrast the functioning of different languages.
In this talk, we will address three points.
First, we will focus on syntactic complexity by showing that the study of dependency flux (the set of concomitant dependencies in every inter-word position) allows us to give an alternative interpretation to dependency distance minimization (Liu 2008) and constraints on self-embeding. The asymmetry in potential flux between head-final and head-initial configurations could explain why head-initial languages are rarer and more constrained than head-final languages. (Collaboration with Chunxiao Yan.)
We will then see how treebanks allow us to extract quantified grammatical information and to approach typological studies from a new angle, which we call typometrics. We will focus on different properties of word order and their visualization by scatterplots. The quantitative approach allows us to verify and extend the categorical universals of language, but also to propose new kinds of universals. (Collaboration with Kim Gerdes and Xinying Chen).
We will conclude by mentioning a new research project that aims at extracting from treebanks the main constructions of each language, thus giving a typological signature of the language. The goal is to extract specific properties of each language, unlike previous works where the same property is studied on all languages and might not be relevant for some languages.

* [Emily Pitler](http://www.emilypitler.com/), Google: _Incorporating Compositionality and Morphology into End-to-End Models_

> Many neural end-to-end systems today do not rely on syntactic parse trees, as much of the information that parse trees provide is encoded in the parameters of pretrained models. Lessons learned from parsing technologies and from taking a multilingual perspective, however, are still relevant even for end-to-end models. This talk will describe work that relies on compositionality in semantic parsing and in reading comprehension requiring numerical reasoning. We’ll then describe a released dataset that requires advances in multilingual modeling, and some approaches designed to better model morphology than off-the-shelf subword models that make some progress on these challenges.

### <a name="instructions"> Paper submission information </a>

#### Submission page
Papers must be submitted in PDF format exclusively through the SyntaxFest 
[joint submission page](
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=syntaxfest2021)


#### Paper length
We invite two types of submissions: long papers and short papers.
- Long papers may consist of up to 10 pages of content (excluding references and appendices);
- Short papers may consist of up to 6 pages of content (excluding references and appendices).
- Any appendices should be included in the paper PDF.

#### Style guidelines
All submissions should follow the common SyntaxFest 2021 stylesheet (based on the one-column COLING 2020 style guidelines). Stylesheets are provided as LaTeX style file and Microsoft Word templates (templates might be subject to slight modifications for compatibility reasons). The files are downloadable from [Depling site](https://depling.org/depling2021/). See section _Style guidelines_.

#### Double-blind reviews

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Zeng, 2018) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Zeng (2018) previously showed ...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

### <a name="review"> Shared reviewing process </a>

On the [submission site](
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=syntaxfest2021), authors submit their paper only once for the whole SyntaxFest, composed of 4 conferences, but they can uncheck conferences they do not wish their paper to be considered for. If the paper is deemed appropriate for more than one of the selected conferences, the SyntaxFest joint organization committee decides on the final placement of the paper, which implies the day of the presentation and the proceedings the paper will appear in.
